## Release v0.5.3

This release brings a smoother and more intuitive experience across billing, account management, and settings. The Top-Up page has been redesigned for clarity, now showcasing a detailed billing summary and an easy-to-navigate layout. Users can select their preferred payment method with clear confirmation of amounts and prices, plus helpful messages to guide minimum top-up requirements. The sidebar and button labels have been updated to better reflect billing and subscription services, making navigation more straightforward. On the home page, content displays more reliably, ensuring full HTML pages render correctly without needing external links. Settings have been reorganized into clearer categories, simplifying customization and account control with new tabs for basics, user authentication, business operations, content management, monitoring, and interface personalization. These thoughtful enhancements combine to make managing your account, payments, and preferences easier and more transparent than ever.
