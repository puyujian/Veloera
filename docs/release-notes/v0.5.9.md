## Release v0.5.9

This update brings several improvements to enhance your experience. We've introduced a new login option with IDC Flare OAuth support, making signing in smoother and more secure. The app’s icon has been refreshed with a modern new design for a cleaner, more polished look. Behind the scenes, request handling is now more efficient and reliable, ensuring better performance and support for text and images while restricting unsupported formats. You’ll also benefit from new usage statistics that track total calls and activity rates, helping you monitor your engagement easily. Plus, we've made small but meaningful tweaks to keep the interface consistent and user-friendly. Lastly, we’ve added information on how to support the project and join our contributor community, inviting you to be part of our growth.
